# ParquetViewer
Simple Windows desktop application for viewing Apache Parquet files

# Download
If you'd like to use a pre-compiled EXE instead of compiling the project yourself, please see the release folder: https://github.com/mukunku/ParquetViewer/tree/master/release

# Technical Details
The project was written in C# using Visual Studio 2013 and .NET 4.5

If you'd like to build the project yourself you only need to download the src folder.

# Summary
This is a quick and dirty utility that I created to easily view Apache Parquet files on Windows desktop machines. 
The Parquet.NET library that does all the actual work is not heavily optimized so performance within this application
is far from ideal.

# Acknowledgements
This utility would not be possible without: https://github.com/elastacloud/parquet-dotnet
